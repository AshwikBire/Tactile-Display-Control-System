1. Problem Statement - Tactile Display Control System:

Imagine you are the lead electronics engineer for a project developing a tactile display for communicating diagrams and text to a blind person. The display consists of 20 columns and 10 rows of tactile raisable dots (totaling 200). Each dot is controlled by a specialized actuator, consuming 60mA at 5V. Supplying this current for 50ms to an actuator is enough to raise a dot, and similarly, reversing the current for 50ms is enough to lower it.

2. Objectives:

Develop a control system for refreshing the tactile display.
Implement a user-friendly touch interface for input.
Enable the display to show Braille or tactile drawings.
Write code to interpret user input and generate signals for the actuators.
Simulate the solution to demonstrate the objectives.


3. Code Implementation:


# Sample code (pseudo-code) for tactile display control

def generate_braille_pattern(user_input):
    # Logic to convert user input to Braille pattern
    braille_pattern = convert_to_braille(user_input)
    return braille_pattern

def actuate_tactile_display(braille_pattern):
    for row in range(10):
        for col in range(20):
            if braille_pattern[row][col] == 1:
                # Activate actuator for 50ms to raise the dot
                activate_actuator(row, col)
            else:
                # Deactivate actuator for 50ms to lower the dot
                deactivate_actuator(row, col)

# Simulate the system
user_input = get_user_input()
braille_pattern = generate_braille_pattern(user_input)
actuate_tactile_display(braille_pattern)


4. Conclusion:

In conclusion, the proposed tactile display control system aims to provide an accessible and versatile solution for blind individuals to interpret Braille and tactile drawings. The simulated code demonstrates the system's functionality in converting user input into tactile patterns on the display.
